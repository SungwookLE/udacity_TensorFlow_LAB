- I recommand that to read and write , so that make it yours.., It looks simple but, hard to fully understand

# STEP1: onelayer_with_sigmoid

# STEP2: twolayer_with_sigmoid

how to implement the backpropagtion to hidden layer that is compose of sigmoid

# STEP3: two_with_relu

relu looks different and more powerful (not vanishing gradinet!)
